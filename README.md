# Business Card

### Portfolio of Software Developer, amateur guitarist and man of passion.

I have created this project to present my skills and myself. This is also my first project in CodersCamp Front-end project.

Technologies that I used here are CSS, HTML and SCSS. I've also added RWD, so page will be correctly displayed in different resolutions.
However this page is mainly about development, but it can be easly used as template for other purposes.

In future it will be expanded to JS/TS and porbably Angular or React.
